# Datasets

- Times Higher Education World University Ranking (THE):
  - The Times Higher Education Impact Rankings are the only global performance tables that assess universities against the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
- Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU):
  - emphasizes research power and raw metrics like publications and Nobel laureates. Critics argue that it undervalues humanities and instructional quality.
- Center for World University Rankings (CWUR):
  - CWUR uses various indicators like research output and quality of faculty to rank universities. (ranking from Saudi Arabia)

## Datasets issues

- Do we have to use all datasets? **yes**

- Center World University Ranking:

  - fake nulls (for what it looks like unis without rank)

- Times Higher Education World University Ranking:

  - Location 6% missing (we may need to fill it from google)
  - missing links (no action needed)
  - what is SDG :

  - data date to 2023 (after researching and matching the results i found that the dataset belong to [Impact Rankings 2023](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/impactrankings))

- Shanghai Ranking:
  - Identical Scores: In the global ranking, there may be duplicates with identical scores.
  - Range Ranks: Universities are ranked within ranges rather than precise positions.
  - Alphabetical Order: If universities share the same rank, they are ordered alphabetically.
  - Outliers: Top university scores are considered outliers as many scores are concentrated below the top 25.
  - uplicates: Duplicates may occur within national rankings as well.
  - The provided data reflects the year 2022 and has undergone extensive research and matching to ensure accuracy. However, users should exercise caution in drawing conclusions due to potential inaccuracies stemming from duplicate entries and lack of timeliness.
