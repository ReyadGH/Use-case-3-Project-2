# Datasets

- Times Higher Education World University Ranking (THE):

## Datasets issues

- Do we have to use all datasets?

- Center World University Ranking:

  - fake nulls (for what it looks like unis without rank)

- Times Higher Education World University Ranking:
  - Location 6% missing (we may need to fill it from google)
  - missing links (no action needed)
  - what is SDG (value, numbers)
